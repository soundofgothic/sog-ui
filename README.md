of an app can be found on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/soundofgothic/dashboard/) 


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

For development you can use public version of api, but you can install it localy (repository is placed in the same GitHub organisation)

## Code scaffolding
